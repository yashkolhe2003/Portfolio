You cannot be sure how HTML will be displayed.

Large or small screens, and resized windows will create different results.

With HTML, you cannot change the display by adding extra spaces or extra lines in your HTML code.

The browser will automatically remove any extra spaces and lines when the page is displayed:

Example
<p>
This paragraph
contains a lot of lines
in the source code,
but the browser
ignores it.
</p>
HTML Paragraphs
The HTML <p> element defines a paragraph.

A paragraph always starts on a new line, and browsers automatically add some white space (a margin) before and after a paragraph.

Example
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
<p>This is another paragraph.</p>

HTML Horizontal Rules
The <hr> tag defines a thematic break in an HTML page, and is most often displayed as a horizontal rule.

The <hr> element is used to separate content (or define a change) in an HTML page:

Example
<h1>This is heading 1</h1>
<p>This is some text.</p>
<hr>
<h2>This is heading 2</h2>
<p>This is some other text.</p>
<hr>
The <hr> tag is an empty tag, which means that it has no end tag.

HTML Line Breaks
The HTML <br> element defines a line break.

Use <br> if you want a line break (a new line) without starting a new paragraph:

Example
<p>This is<br>a paragraph<br>with line breaks.</p>
</p>
